Multi-source remote sensing image datasets 

We collected four types of multisource remote sensing image datasets from publicly available literature. 
These include optical-depth, infrared-optical, optical-electronic map, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical image pairs. 
Each type of dataset comprises ten image pairs, each with a size of 512Ã—512.
